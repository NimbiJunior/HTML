    <h2>briefly about us</h2>
    <div> 
        <span>Victoria's Secret is an American lingerie, clothing, and beauty retailer known for high visibility marketing and branding, starting with a popular catalog and followed by an annual fashion show with supermodels dubbed Angels. As the largest retailer of lingerie in the United States, the brand has struggled since 2016 due to shifting consumer preferences and controversy surrounding corporate leadership's business practices.

            Founded in 1977 by Roy and Gaye Raymond,[6][7] the company's five lingerie stores were sold to Leslie Wexner in 1982.[8] Wexner rapidly expanded into American shopping malls, growing the company into 350 stores nationally with sales of $1 billion by the early 1990s when Victoria's Secret became the largest lingerie retailer in the United States.[9]</span>
