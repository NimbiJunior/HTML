    <h2>briefly about us</h2>
    <div> 
        <span>Victoria's Secret is an American lingerie, clothing, and beauty retailer known for high visibility marketing and branding, starting with a popular catalog and followed by an annual fashion show with supermodels dubbed Angels. As the largest retailer of lingerie in the United States, the brand has struggled since 2016 due to shifting consumer preferences and controversy surrounding corporate leadership's business practices.

            Founded in 1977 by Roy and Gaye Raymond,[6][7] the company's five lingerie stores were sold to Leslie Wexner in 1982.[8] Wexner rapidly expanded into American shopping malls, growing the company into 350 stores nationally with sales of $1 billion by the early 1990s when Victoria's Secret became the largest lingerie retailer in the United States.[9]</span>

        <p>History
            1977–1981
            Victoria's Secret was founded by Roy Raymond, and his wife, Gaye Raymond,[6][7][2] on June 12, 1977.[19][8] The first store was opened in the Stanford Shopping Center in Palo Alto, California.[8] Years earlier, Raymond was embarrassed when purchasing lingerie for his wife at a department store. Newsweek reported Roy Raymond stating: "When I tried to buy lingerie for my wife, I was faced with racks of terry-cloth robes and ugly floral-print nylon nightgowns, and I always had the feeling the department store saleswomen thought I was an unwelcome intruder."[20] Raymond reportedly spent the next eight years studying the lingerie market.[21][2]</p>

                <p>At the time when the Raymonds founded Victoria's Secret, the undergarments market in the U.S. was dominated by pragmatic items from Fruit of the Loom, Hanes, and Jockey, often sold in packs of three at department stores, while lingerie was reserved for special occasions such as one's honeymoon.[22] Considered niche products, lingerie items (such as lacy thongs and padded push-up bras) were only found in specialty shops like Frederick's of Hollywood, located “alongside feathered boas and provocative pirate costumes“.[22] In 1977, Raymond borrowed $40,000 from family and $40,000 from a bank to establish Victoria's Secret: a store in which men could feel comfortable buying lingerie.[8][23] The store was named in reference to Queen Victoria and the associated refinement of the Victorian era, while the "secret" was hidden underneath the clothes.[23]</p>

                    <p>Victoria's Secret grossed $500,000 in its first year of business,[8] enough to finance the expansion from a headquarters and warehouse to four new store locations[24] and a mail-order operation.[8] The fourth store, added in 1982 at 395 Sutter Street in San Francisco,[25] operated at that location until 1990, when it was moved to the larger Powell Street frontage of the Westin St. Francis.[26]

                        In April 1982, Raymond sent out his 12th catalog at a cost to customers of $3 (equivalent to $8.42 in 2021); catalog sales accounted for 55% of the company's $7 million annual sales that year.[25] Victoria's Secret was a minor player in the underwear market at this time, with the business described as "more burlesque than Main Street."[27]</p>

                    <div>In 1982, Victoria's Secret had grown to five stores, a 40-page catalog, and was grossing $6 million annually.[8] Raymond sold the company to Les Wexner, creator of Limited Stores Inc of Columbus, Ohio, for $1 million.[8][28] In 1983, Wexner revamped Victoria's Secret's sales model towards a greater focus on female customers.[29] Victoria's Secret transformed into a mainstay that sold broadly accepted underwear with "new colors, patterns and styles that promised sexiness packaged in a tasteful, glamorous way and with the snob appeal of European luxury" meant to appeal to female buyers.[29] To further this image, the Victoria's Secret catalog continued the practice that Raymond began:[30] listing the company's headquarters on catalogs at a fake London address, with the real headquarters in Columbus, Ohio.[29] The stores were redesigned to evoke 19th century England.</div>
                    <div>The New York Times reported in 1982 that the financial success of the Victoria's Secret catalog influenced other catalogs by presenting lingerie as "romantic and sensual but tasteful", "in which models are photographed in ladylike poses against elegant backgrounds."[25] Howard Gross became president in 1985.[31] In October of that year, the Los Angeles Times reported that Victoria's Secret was stealing market share from department stores;[32] in 1986, Victoria's Secret was the only national chain devoted to lingerie.[33]</div>
                    <div>The New York Times reported that Victoria's Secret swiftly expanded to 100 stores by 1986.[34] and described it in 1987 as a "highly visible leader" that used "unabashedly sexy high-fashion photography to sell middle-priced underwear."[35] In 1990, analysts estimated that sales had quadrupled in four years, making it one of the fastest growing mail-order businesses.[36] Sales and profits from the catalog continued to expand due to the addition of clothing, swimwear and shoes and wider circulation.[citation needed]

                        Cynthia Fedus-Fields oversaw the company's direct business, including its catalog, from the mid-1980s until 2000.[37]  During her tenure, total revenues increased to nearly $1 billion.[37] In 1987, Victoria's Secret was reported to be among the bestselling catalogs.[38][39]</div>
